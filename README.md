## Description
Nationwide migrations have drawn much attention from both geographical and social sciences. Compared to
census-data-based studies, data collected from broadly used location-awareness devices enable us to describe
migrant patterns with timely and fine spatial resolutions. Using a mobile positioning dataset, this paper first
analyzes the spatial patterns of mobile-data-based active population estimation (MAPE) and aims to uncover the
socioeconomic factors associated with migrant patterns based on the MAPE change around the Chinese Spring
Festival of 2016. Time series analysis presents obvious regular patterns and characteristics of MAPE before and
during the holiday. Results from a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model show that MAPE differences
are significantly associated with the development of secondary and tertiary industries, wage levels and foreign
investments. Spatial disparities of the GWR model coefficients reveal that areas in China have different degrees
of association with the explanatory variables. Explanations of this spatial nonstationary phenomenon are further
detailed with the perspective of a geographical background. Finally, associated social and economic development
strategies among cities in China are analyzed, and policy implications regarding the newly emerged data
and their insightful findings are discussed.
